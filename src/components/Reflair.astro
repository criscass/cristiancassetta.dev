				Mia Lambrechts, a highly skilled interior designer based in Pretoria, South Africa, needed someone to update and
				maintain her WordPress website regularly. When I began working on it, I quickly noticed that the website was
				painfully slow. Together with Mia, we decided to rewrite the entire website in code while preserving the original
				design. I chose to use Astro, which is excellent for static websites, along with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS. The
				result is a lightning-fast website that is very easy to update in the future, thanks to Astro's powerful content
				templating capabilities.
